# Simple Digital Clock
A simple display of the time using TypeScript

This web app shows how time is displayed on a web page. It uses TypeScript plus JavaScript's native Date object to render the current time.
There's nothing intuitive about this web app, as it's just rendering an already existing feature.

The next steps here are to beautify the display with CSS to make it look more visually pleasing, and probably add a different timezone
to the web app to make it possible to render the time for other time zones.

## Step 1: Create a simple digital clock
- Using TypeScript create a simple digital clock

## Step 2: Add CSS styling to the digital clock
- Using a digital font to achieve a digital clock look and feel
- Add a simple button to alter the color of the clock based on user click

## Step 3: Use a Typed Framework to write JSX
- Using Atlaskit to write the JSX part of the app, it should handle both CSS and HTML elements
- Use another framework for the icons or any other typed version to help structure the app
- Create a project structure to document the stages of the app development
