# Simple Digital Clock
A simple display of the time using TypeScript

This web app shows how time is displayed on a web page. It uses TypeScript plus JavaScript's native Date object to render the current time.
There's nothing intuitive about this web app, as it's just rendering an already existing feature.

The next steps here are to beautify the display with CSS to make it look more visually pleasing, and probably add a different timezone
to the web app to make it possible to render the time for other time zones.
